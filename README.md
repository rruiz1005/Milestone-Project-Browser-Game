This game is called "Connect 4"

Rules:
The objective of the game is to get 4 of your pieces in a row vertically, diagonally, or horizontally.
Each player gets to choose one column to set there piece at a time, the first player to get four in a row wins.
If no player gets four in a row, the game results in a draw.

Why I chose Connect 4:
Connect 4 was always one of my favorite board games as it was a quick and simple but also very strategic game. Learning new ways to win and changing strategies as needed based on your opponent made the game fun and unpredictable, created a endless possibilites for how the game can play out.


My process:
Creating the game board itself was simple as you can just make a grid or a table to create your slots for the game pieces.
My struggles were in creating the win conditions. At first I just created an array listing every possible winning play but wasnt comfortable with how that was coded. I was then able to create functions for the win conditions as well as for the draw. Styling was pretty fun as I had to figure out how to make the slots rounded to have a similar look to the original Connect 4 game board. Aside from that I was able to add my own touches by choosing my own colors to make it my own.
